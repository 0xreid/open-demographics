Todo List
---------------------------

In addition to the official `issue queue <https://github.com/drnikki/open-demographics/issues/>`_ ,
contextual todos are sprinkled throughout the documentation.  (These are a great way to get involved!)

..todo::
  - Get rid of the full local path in the todos :/
  - put "create issue about this page" link the the footer of every question
