How to get involved
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The `issue queue <https://github.com/drnikki/open-demographics/issues/>`_ is a great place to start.  There are a few ways to get started:

Fork/Change/PR
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you're familiar with github workflows (fork, change, PR), then you're already familiar with the fastest way to get started.  Go ahead and fork the repo, make your changes in a branch, and then open a PR.  If possible, include the issue #, and don't forget to add yourself to the contributors file if you're not already there.

Add Comments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The *most valuable* contributions from people are their ideas. Look through our questions, and our issues, and if you want to see something changed, please (after you create/sign in to github) `create an issue <https://github.com/drnikki/open-demographics/issues/new>`_.
