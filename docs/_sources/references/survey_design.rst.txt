This document is intended to share as much as possible of the literature/refrences that were considered when working on this project.  A lot of good work is behind academic paywalls, and so is included here for easy and equitable access.




Researching queer identities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
"Within queer theory, Jagose, among others, highlights the instability of identity categories, arguing that “queeris an identity category that has no interest in consolidating or even stabilizing
itself... [Q]ueer is always an identity under construction”" :cite:`doan_count_2016`

The politics of counting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:cite:`doan_count_2016` (p92) talks about "counting as broadly as possible."  If one can count "broadly," then one can also count narrowly, strictly, partically, etc.  cCounting itself is not a value-netural activity.

When writing questions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A literature review/evaluation of surveys is given in :cite:`dolnicar_asking_2013` and references studies mostly used for market and tourism research.  A good overview.
