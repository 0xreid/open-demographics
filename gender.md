### Rationale
Not all gender non-conforming people consider themselves to be transgender, which is why it is a separate question.

We separate the question of trans* and gender-non-conforming to include people with intersecting identities of "non-conforming" and "any other gender identity."  Because it is structured this way, people can identify as "male" and "gender non conforming."
