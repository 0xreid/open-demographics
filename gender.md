### Gender Identification

    Do you consider yourself to be transgender/gender non-conforming?
    () Yes
    () No

    What is your primary gender identity today?
    () Female
    () Genderqueer
    () Intersex
    () Male
    () Trans F-M
    () Trans M-F
    () Prefer not to answer
    [___________] Self-identify


### Rationale
We separate the question of trans*/gender-non-conforming to include people with intersecting identities of "non-conforming" and "any other gender identity."  Because it is structured this way, people can identify as "male" and "gender non conforming."
