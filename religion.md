### Religious Identification

    Do you practice, worship, or observe a particular religion (or agnostic/atheist theology)?
    () Yes
    () No

    Do you identify as a minority because of your religion (or lack thereof)?
    () Yes
    () No
    () N/A


### Rationale

Rather than asking users to choose their religious identity, we've opted to ask whether or not they're a religious minority in their area. This is inclusive to people who identify as agnostic, and allows people who may be religious majorities in some areas and minorities in others to choose the status that best describes them.
