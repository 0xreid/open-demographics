Q: Religious Identification
---------------------------

The Question
.......................................
::

      Do you practice, worship, or observe a particular religion (or agnostic/atheist theology)?
      () Yes
      () No

      Do you identify as a minority because of your religion (or lack thereof)?
      () Yes
      () No
      () N/A


Rationale
......................................
Rather than asking users to choose their religious identity, we've opted to ask whether or not they're a religious minority in their area. This is inclusive to people who identify as agnostic, and allows people who may be religious majorities in some areas and minorities in others to choose the status that best describes them.

.. todo::
   This religion question is not helpful if you're trying to understand how many people in your community practice a certain religion.  We'll need to make a recommendation for that as well. Please `create an issue <https://github.com/drnikki/open-demographics/issues/new?title=Religion&body=Your%20great%20ideas>`_ if you have ideas.
