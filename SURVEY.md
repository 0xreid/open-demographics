## How do you identify?

Turns out, diversity is hard to classify [3].  It's personal, contextual, and depends as much on who you are as who you are around.  Here are some identifiers we're going to consider.

    *. Ability - Mental and/or physical
    *. Age
    *. Ethnicity
    *. Gender
    *. Race
    *. Religion
    *. Sexual Orientation
    *. Socio-Economic Status/Class
    *. ? / & / Etc.*

(insert the questions you are choosing to include here)



### ? / & / Etc.

What else do you identify with?  Call out anything we've missed that makes you, well, you!
    [                   ]

    add as many as appropriate.
